# Minecraft 1.16 - Nether Update

So on 23rd, June, Mojang released Minecraft 1.16 and the corresponding patch notes. As always I want to make a video about it, but the note is, well, extremely huge and urr, disordered. So I decided to spend some time and make one myself.

There might be some mistake, so if you see any, please contact me :\)

**Note:** This website is **NOT related to Mojang**. And if anything gets wrong, it's my fault, not theirs.

## World Files
- Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc)
    - `BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields)
- Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to increase reliability
    - For performance reasons this feature is disabled by default on non-Windows clients
    - can be manually controlled by following options:â€¨
        - For dedicated servers: `sync-chunk-writes` within `server.properties`
        - For clients: `syncChunkWrites` within `options.txt`
- New tags fields for item frames
    - `Invisible` - makes item frame invisible (item inside frame remains visible)
    - `Fixed` - prevents item frame from being broken and item inside from being removed
- UUIDs in NBT
    - now represented as an array of four integers. Example: `{UUID:[I;1498693494,1027158888,1898994005,860320107]}`
    - Renamed fields:
        - `OwnerUUID` of tamed animals, area effect clouds, evoker fangs and projectiles is now simply `Owner`
        - `TrustedUUIDs` of foxes is now `Trusted`
        - `target_uuid` of conduits is now `Target`
- Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
- `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

## Custom Worlds
- Added experimental support for new custom worlds
- Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
- During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
- A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
- Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
- Buffet world can no longer be created from `server.properties`, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

    - `minecraft:gold_ores`
    - `minecraft:nylium`
    - `minecraft:wart_blocks`
    - `minecraft:crimson_stems`
    - `minecraft:warped_stems`
- Item tags
    - `minecraft:gold_ores`
    - `minecraft:piglin_repellents` - determine the items piglins will try to avoid from
    - `minecraft:hoglin_repellets` - determine the items hoglins will try to avoid from

    - `minecraft:crimson_stems`
    - `minecraft:warped_stems`
- Entity tags
    - `minecraft:impact_projevtiles` - determine which entity can break purpur plant or trigger target blocks

## Gamerules
- `universalAnger` (disabled by default)
    - makes angered neutral mobs attack any nearby player â€“ not just the player that angered them. Works best if you disable `forgiveDeadPlayers`
    - if enabled:
        - a neutral mob attacked by a player will target the nearest player, even if that player wasn't the attacker
        - Every time the neutral mob is hit by a player it will update its attack target to the nearest player
        - Players can use this to make neutral mobs attack other players.
        - Universal anger only apply when it is attacked by a player
        - Universal anger is persistent. The angered mob will stay angry even if the player logs out and logs in, or jumps through a portal and back
        - Mobs that spread anger will also spread universal anger. So if a player attacks a Zombified Piglin, all other Zombified Piglins within sight will be universally angry and attack their nearest player
        - An angered neutral mob will stop being angry if it can't see any eligible target for a while
- `forgiveDeadPlayers` (enabled by default)
    - makes angered neutral mobs stop being angry when the targeted player dies nearby
    - If disabled, angered mobs will stay angry even if the targeted player dies
    - If both `forgiveDeadPlayers` and `universalAnger` are enabled, an angered neutral mob will stop being angry when their target dies. They won't seek any new targets after that

## Advancement Triggers
- Added `target_hit` trigger type
    - `signal_strength` matches the signal strength output from the block on hit
    - `projectile` matches the projectile entity
    - `shooter` matches the player who shot or threw the projectile
- Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` trigger type
    - `item` matches the thrown item which was picked up
    - `entity` matches the entity which picked up the item
- Added `player_generates_container_loot` trigger type
    - `loot_table` matches the resource location of the generated loot table
- Added `item_used_on_block` trigger type
    - `location` matches the location at the center of the block the item was used on
    - `item` matches the item used on the block
- Removed `safely_harvest_honey` trigger type
- Added `player` check to every trigger except `impossible`
    - existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.
- `location` got a new property `smokey` which checks if the location is closely above a campfire
- `entity_properties` got new properties `vehicle` and `targetedEntity` which match the vehicle or the entity targeted by a mob
- Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax
    - Old notation:
    ```json
    {
        "trigger": "minecraft:playerkilledentity",
        "conditions": {
            "entity":
                { "type": "minecraft:blaze" }
        }
    }
    ```
    is now equivalent to:
    ```json
    {
        "trigger": "minecraft:playerkilledentity",
        "conditions": {
            "entity": [
                {
                    "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
                     "predicate": {
                     "type": "minecraft:blaze"
                 },
             "entity": "this"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```
    **Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger.  
    **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.
    - Full list of extended triggers:â€¨
        - New field `player` in every trigger
        - `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`

## Visuals
- Text style changes
    - Chat component style can now select font and more colors
        - `color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`
        - `font` property is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`
    - Full range of Unicode characters is now supported (some may know what that means ðŸ˜‰)
    - Hover event argument
        - `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter contents, with contents depending on type:
            - For `show_text` - chat component
            - For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields id, count, and tag (with last one being serialized NBT)
            - For `show_entity` - object with fields: id (UUID), name (chat component), and type (entity type resource location)
        - Old style value argument is now deprecated (but still supported)
    - Force Unicode option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) â€“ no reload needed
- New particle types:
    - ash
    - crimson_spore
    - soulfire_flame
    - warped_spore
    - dripping_obsidian_tear
    - falling_obsidian_tear
    - landing_obsidian_tear
    - soul
- Nether biomes has different color of fog, and they blends smoothly.
- Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
- Changed ambient block lighting in the Nether for parity with Bedrock edition
- Rendering tweaks
    - Nailed Entity shadows to the ground
    - Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
    - Added shader support for accessing depth buffer
    - Added new "Fabulous!" graphics option
        - This uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements

## Miscallaneous
- Block placement changes
    - Ladders and tripwire hooks can now be placed on observers, redstone blocks, and target blocks
    - Doors, rails, buttons, pressure plates, redstone, and more can now be placed on soulsand and full-block of snow layers
    - Soulsand with a rail on top will no longer slow down minecarts
- General statistics list is now alphabetically sorted
- Added strider_one_cm custom statistics for riding Striders
- Added a `enable-status` option to the `server.properties` file which if set to false will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen
- Mobs avoid walking on magma blocks and lit campfires
- Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance
- Minor optimizations in collision detection
- Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
    - Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example 50 specifies half of the default range
- Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times
    - The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools. This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.
    - A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the `server.properties` file which if set to true will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds
    - In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html)
- New command line options
    - `disableChat` - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled
    - `disableMultiplayer` â€“ when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
- Shulkers with `NoAI` can now be summoned with rotation
- Expanded the max size per axis of structure blocks from 32 to 48
- Increased view distance in lava slightly while having the fire resistance effect
