# Minecraft Earth Java Edition

Um so the idea of making Minecraft Earth (MCE) into Java Edition (MC) just randomly popped out of my mind.
Some of you might have seen SethBling done [the same thing][seth] before, but that was the time when MCE not even published.

So anyways I'll take on this challenge and try to see how far I can go OWO

And I'll post my progress here I think. Like having some screenshot for me working on the models, functions, etc.

Well anyways stay tuned for the updates!
