**Select Minecraft Folder**

Normally on startup, the app will automatically find your minecraft folder, but you can also manually change it on your own.

There's a button by the text editor, pressing it will open a file chooser, you can choose your minecraft folder as you wanted.

**Minecraft Assets Version**

After choosing your minecraft folder, the app will detect available versions and list them out. To be available, that version should have been run before, so we can grab things properly.

**Output File Limit**

The max count of files being unhashed and copied. Leave it blank to unhash all files.

**Write Hashtable**

Hashtable txt file will be put in `<mcfolder>/assets_unhash/<version>.txt`. Format: `<hash> -> <file name>`

**Unhash Assets Files**

Unhashed files will be copied to `<mcfolder>/assets_unhash/<version>` folder.
